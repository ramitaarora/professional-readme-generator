# Professional README Generator

## UCLA Bootcamp Module 9 Challenge

## Description

This project helps developers quickly create a professional README file for a new project. Upon running this application, the user will be prompted for the following information:

1. Project title
2. Description
3. Installation Instructions
4. Usage Information
5. Contributions
6. Test instructions
7. Contact information (email, github link)
8. License

The user will also be able to choose a license from a list of options. Upon choosing their option, the badge for that license will be added near the top of the README and information will be added to the license section.

The markdown will be created with the answers to the questions, as well as having a clickable Table of Contents.
